# Summary
I had a great time networking and learning more about the "Colorado Data Science" Meetup group. The event was hosted by SendGrid and NVIDIA and featured a keynote speaker from each company. In addition to a great evening, all attendees were invited and granted FREE admission to the “Cognitive Builder Faire” conference upcoming in June. This will be a “hack-a-thon” type conference which takes place June 9-11. 

Victor, a Data Scientist from SendGrid, presented on the importance of reducing "data latency", which he defined as anything that introduces inefficiency between that Data Scientist and the end result. Latency could be techincal such as stack or database performance, but also could signify bureaucratic latency such as submitting (and waiting extending periods of time) for access to the appropriate database. 

Eric, a Data Scientist from NVIDIA, presented more about the rise and importance of GPUs (vs CPUs) in all applications of data science. He had some really interesting examples of case studies where organizations are leveraging GPUs for intensive machine learning applications, such as neural networking and deep learning. 

All-in-all, it was a great evening and I look forward to the upcoming conference as well as continuing to attend other analytics related Meetup events.
